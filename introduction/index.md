## About Me

My name is Hui Gao and I am currently a research associate of optical engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and National University of Singapore (dual culture). My research interests lie in Holographic Display, Metasurface, Micro/Nano-optics, etc.

## Thoughts

I have been fascinated by "optics" for a long time—this intangible little fairy has truly captivated me. I remember in middle school when we learned about holography in physics. With only a vague understanding, my friend and I went online to get a small laser and holographic plate, trying to recreate this magical phenomenon. Although we ultimately didn't succeed, this experience led me to dive into the world of optics without hesitation when I later entered university. Optics covers a wide range of subjects: geometric optics, physical optics, electromagnetic fields, quantum optics, optoelectronics, color science, visual science, Fourier optics, and so on—knowledge that seemed almost like magic flooded my mind. Although I was too slow to grasp many of these concepts, years of systematic education seemed to open a door for me, leading me into this breathtakingly beautiful garden!

However, after years of higher education, while I was in awe of the wonders of nature, I also realized that I had many misconceptions about the world. The real world has no smooth surfaces, no rigid bodies, no spherical chickens in a vacuum. In reality, lenses have aberrations, mirrors have absorption, and the development of dynamic holography has almost stagnated. What was presented in middle school textbooks as simple and elegant truths was actually a necessary approximation.

Apart from these misconceptions, I once had many unrealistic expectations of science. Science has brought humanity countless great achievements, but the further we go, the more we realize that our understanding of the world is full of gaps. I remember studying physics back then, reading about the long-lasting battle between the particle and wave theories of light, and about the history of modern physics over the past century. I couldn't help but be exhilarated, as if the truth of the universe was slowly unfolding, and we were on the verge of a revelation. But after years of PhD research, reading cutting-edge papers and hearing the views of the greatest scientists of our time, I realized that we are still fundamentally ignorant about the nature of the world: we don't know this, and we don't know that either.

It's like reading an unfinished novel online—drawn in by the plot, you can't stop, so you pay for a membership. But then you discover that, although the author is still updating 5,000 words daily, the story is filled with trivial details, and the main plotline has almost stopped progressing... Even Professor Pan Jianwei once said, "As long as I understand why quantum entanglement exists, I can die immediately." This "if I can understand the way, I can die content" mentality is truly admirable, but it also reflects the helplessness humanity faces when confronting the vastness of the universe.

Although there is inevitable disappointment, my years in research have made me realize one important truth: scientific research must be down-to-earth; you can't get results instantly. If you don't study the deep theories or carefully do the mathematical derivations, relying solely on wild ideas and trying to make a big splash, you will end up as the pejorative "amateur scientist." Thus, research must be patient. Every small scientific achievement, no matter how minor, has irreplaceable value, just as Mr. Hu Shi once said, "Why fear the infinite pursuit of truth? Every inch forward brings an inch of joy."

Thanks to our great motherland, to this magnificent era, and to the guidance of my mentor, who has given me the opportunity to explore and seek knowledge. Full of ambition, I set off on my journey, ready to witness the world's dazzling beauty! O(∩_∩)O Haha
